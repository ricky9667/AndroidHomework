## Answer These Questions

### Question 1

In which lifecycle method do you save the app state to shared preferences?

- `onPause()`

### Question 2

In which lifecycle method do you restore the app state?

- `onCreate()`

### Question 3

Can you think of a case where it makes sense to have both shared preferences and instance state?

- `saveInstanceState` are used when you need to frequently moving back and forth between activities, and `SharedPreferences` are used when you want to keep information for long time. So you may use both if you need to frequently update data to view and to local storage.
